Document the Steps that were needed to carry out the audEERING coding Task

* Step 1 - Building the dataset

Dataset creation is done via gradle task, so for recap, a working gradle installation is
required. The database is expected to have been extracted into the `data/raw subdirectory` sich that
the path to the wav-files is `data/raw/wav/` 
The task itself can be invoked via

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./gradlew makeDataSet 
#+END_SRC

The shell script `wav2features.sh` that is called during the task to date requires some extra work, as some env
variables are currently hardcoded.


* Step 2 - Run the model for Report Generation 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./gradlew makeModel 
#+END_SRC

* Informal Final Observations
